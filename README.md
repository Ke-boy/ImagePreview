<h3>ImagePreview</h3>
A lightweight, un-cluttered image preview application

<h4>Design Goals</h4>
- Fast ways to display images and convert them to different formats
- Workflow orientation: as few menus, buttons etc. as possible (using shortcuts as commands)
- Good image comparison capabilities: when switching between zooomed-in areas of images, the zoom is not reset

<h4>Todo</h4>
- better antialiasing for scaled down images available in QGraphicsView? (For photos it works good, but not for uniform patterns)
- Fullscreen mode
